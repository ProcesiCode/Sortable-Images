# Sortable-Images

- Sortable-images is an interactive technology that allows users to drag and drop images for easier organization on webpages.
- In short the library is made to be used in vertical sorting like the example provided, however it uses jQuery's sortable library so you have the ability to edit anything using jQuery's documentation.

### The Library is purely made for a specific task, it may be updated in the future with our features, so stay tooned!
